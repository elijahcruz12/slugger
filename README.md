# Slugger

** THIS PROJECT IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, DO NOT USE IT **

Slugger is a simple PHP program that renames files and directories to a slug format.

The goal is to be able to rename files and directories to a slug format. This is useful for SEO purposes, and for creating clean URLs. I also want to make it possible to transform images using Imagick, but with a CLI, that feels easier to use.
